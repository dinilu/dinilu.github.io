<p>I studied Biology at <a title="Universidad de Granada" href="http://www.ugr.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Gran</a><a title="Universidad de Granada" href="http://www.ugr.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ada</a> (Spain), where I also got <a title="PhD Thesis" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33940356/PhD-Thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my PhD</a> on Aerobiology (study of airborne pollen and spores) in 2008. During this period I became interested in spatial analysis and modelling and their applications to interpolate aerobiological data from sampling networks.</p>

<p>Since January 2010, I was working for <a title="Micelios del Sur S.L." href="http://www.misur.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MISUR S.L.</a>, managing the I+D department, supervising the design and building of a growing mushroom factory. This young company aim to use olive oil waste, which is biotoxic, to crop the edible mushroom <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>, whereas the exhausted substrate remain completely harmless.</p>

<p>After one year and a half away from the academia, I got a postdoc in the <a title="Ecoinformatics &amp; Biodiversity Group (Aarhus University)" rel="noopener" href="http://bios.au.dk/en/research/sections/integrative-ecology-and-evolution/ecoinformatics/ecoinformatics-researchprofile/" target="_blank">Ecoinformatic and Biodiversity Group</a> (Aarhus University) to study plant diversity and distribution, and the role of interspecific interactions on spatial modelling. After two years working in Denmark I got a new postdoc in the <a title="Appalachian Lab" rel="noopener" href="http://www.umces.edu/al" target="_blank">Appalachian Lab</a> (University of Maryland - Center for Environmental Science). My research lines included the study of biotic interactions and dispersal limitations using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and Community Level Models (CLMs) through long term records of vegetation changes. I followed my reserch with a new postdoc in the <a href="https://botanica.ugr.es/">Department of Botany</a> (Universidad de Granada) for another year, developing tools (mainly an R-package) to handle and interact with the European Pollen Database.</p>

<p>In September 2016, I joined as assistant professor the <a href="http://www.uco.es/botanica/es/">Department of Botany, Ecology and Plant Physiology</a> (Universidad de CÃ³rdoba), where I have been teaching Botany and Biogeography (Degree level) and Data Analysis in R (Master level). In October 2019, I became associate professor (civil servant).</p>
